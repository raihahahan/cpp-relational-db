# C++ Relational Database

This repository implements a mini relational database system in modern C++. It is inspired by PostgreSQL and upon taking [CS3223 (Database Implementations)](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS3223/database-systems-implementation)

## Overview

This database system is built as a layered architecture, where each layer abstracts a specific level of data management:

1. Query Layer: Parses, optimizes, and executes SQL statements.
2. Execution Layer: Handles query operators (scan, join, aggregate).
3. Buffer Manager: Caches and manages in-memory pages.
4. Storage Layer: Reads/writes pages to disk (raw I/O).

Each layer interacts only with the one directly below it, following clean modular boundaries.

Below is a simplified high-level view of the entire system stack:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++20 or later** (tested with GCC 12+ / Clang 15+)
- **CMake 3.14+**
- **GoogleTest** (fetched automatically via CMake)
- **Make** for simplified build commands

## Build & Test

You can use either CMake directly or the provided Makefile shortcuts.

### Using Makefile

```bash
# Build the project
make build

# Run all tests
make test

# Run DiskManager-specific tests
make test_disk_manager

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Manual CMake Workflow

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make -j
ctest --output-on-failure
```

## Storage Layer Overview

The **storage subsystem** forms the foundation of the database.
It is divided into three layers:

| Component         | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **DiskManager**   | Handles raw page I/O and file operations.       |
| **BufferManager** | Manages in-memory pages and replacement policy. |
| **Slotted Page**  | Organisation of data within each page.          |

For detailed documentation, see the [storage/README.md](src/storage/README.md).

## Project Roadmap

| Phase | Layer                       | Description                                                      | Status  |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 1     | **Storage**                 | Implement DiskManager, BufferManager                             | Done    |
| 2     | **Access**                  | Heap file, B+-tree index, Hash index                             | Planned |
| 3     | **Execution**               | Add query operators and execution plans (scan, join, aggregate). | Planned |
| 4     | **Concurrency**             | Introduce locking, transaction management, and isolation.        | Planned |
| 5     | **Recovery**                | Implement write-ahead logging and crash recovery.                | Planned |
| 6     | **Networking & SQL Parser** | Add a client-server interface and query parsing layer.           | Planned |
